                        <p>Douglas Noel Adams &lpar;<time datetime="1952-03-11">11.03.1952</time> &ndash; <time>11.05.2001</time datetime="2001-05-11">&rpar; was an English writer and artist who has touched the lives of many by combining his critical thinking, imagination, humor, enthusiasm for technology, science-fiction and curiosity for the nature and the universe.</p>

                <div class="details">
                    <h3 id="early-years">Early Years</h3>
                    <p class="history-first">Adams was born in Cambridge, London both into a culture of surging creativity in the <time datetime="1950">1950</time>&apos;s, and into a deeply eccentric yet deeply fractured family.</p>
                    <p class="history">After the age of 5, he left his divorced parents, because of his father's love for booze and other women, and went on to live with his grandparents&apos; place where animals of all stray species were running around since they had a place to eat, sleep and be loved (and occasionally poop).</p>
                    <p class="history">His absurd humor and personality was started to get recognized at the private high school payed by a wealthy widow whom his father&apos;s married. His father also passed onto him his gigantic nose, gigantic bulk and gigantic personality.</p>
                    <p class="history">In the summer of <time datetime="1971">1971</time>, right after high school and before college, Adams was travelling around Europe. One night as he was lying dead drunk in a field in Austria, gazing into the wonders of the universe, and contemplating how he needed a guide on this hitchhiking journey; he got his life-changing idea:  someone needed to write a hitchhiker&apos;s guide, not to Europe, but to the galaxy.</p>

                    <h3 id="adulthood">Adulthood</h3>
                    <h4>This is where it gets long &mdash; Don&apos;t panic!</h4>

                    <p class="history-first">Alcohol might have given him his greatest idea; however, it was also alcohol who has stopped him from working on it, surprise surprise... While spending his time on writing and drinking immeasurably in London after college, he's got a chance to work with Graham Chapman on Monty Python. Although that was a small part of the show, the sketch <cite>Patient Abuse</cite>, the two went on to work on their own comedy sketch project <cite>Out of the Trees</cite>, which also didn't have a long run, but planted the seed of a concept which Adams later became obsessed with: the end&lpar;s&rpar; of the world&lpar;s&rpar;.</p>
                    <p class="history">In <time datetime="1976">1976</time>, broke and semi-aware of his sketch comedy career being almost over, he returned to his mother&apos;s place where he kept trying his hand at writing and performing; but it was a dead end. By <time datetime="1977">1977</time>, he was on the verge of giving up on writing, but the next the year was going to bring drastic changes to his life.</p>
                    <p class="history">After a life-changing lunch with a BBC producer who asked him to try his hand on pilot episode for a sci-fi comedy series, his luck turned around. And what a turn that was... <cite>The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy</cite> soon became a huge success and everybody&apos;s new favorite radio series. What made it so outstanding besides the genius of Adams, was the amount of time, energy and work he put into it. He wanted the Hitchhiker&apos;s to have extraordinary production levels, and he made sure it had what he toiled over for.</p>
                    <p class="history">As winter approached, Adams got two offers which he accepted. The first was the Doctor Who team asking him to write a four-part episode, and the second was Radio 4 asking him for a full series of the Hitchhiker&apos;s. Taking on so much work has soon become a work pattern which trapped Adams in a constant panic mode infused with alcohol, barely able to finish by deadlines. In one way or another, he still got his work done, and the rewards it brought with.</p>
                    <p class="history">All this success made for Adams every writer&apos;s dream come true: money, he had lots of it. He started to radiate his father&apos;s personality by spending his money on cars and parties. Although his writing career didn&apos;t look so bright, his luck kept right on going. At the start of the decade, he met his future wife: Jane Elizabeth Belson, the woman beyond her dreams, but was better because she was real.</p>
                    <p class="history">The couple&apos;s house in Islington was a common party spot where you could run into anyone from John Cleese, to Stephen Fry, to Richard Dawkins (yes, that same Richard Dawkins). But, nobody can argue that the coolest people Adams befriended were Pink Floyd. At these parties, he would hand out guitars, and treat the crowd to an impromptu Pink Floyd gig. I'm not sure if anyone can beat that awesomeness.</p>
                    <p class="history">In the late 1980&apos;s he was over his writer&apos;s block and wrote two <cite>Dirk Gently</cite> detective stories, again cannibalizing an old Doctor Who script and entered the new decade by finally getting married to Belson. However, life has its&apos; ups and downs. In his last 10 years, Adams was in a bleak place of his life. After almost 7 years, he has finally agreed to write the fifth Hitchhiker&apos;s book, but was again hit by writer&apos;s block.</p>
                    <p class="history">Yet, life moves on, so did Adams. Being a nature and endangered species advocate brought a him new sense of life. On his <time datetime="1994-03-11">42nd birthday</time>, he was invited on stage by Pink Floyd to play with them. Later that same year, his daughter Polly Jane Rocket Adams was born.</p>
                    <p class="history">By the 21st century, he was lecturing in Silicon valley, developing video games with his production company, and working on turning Hitchhiker&apos;s into a Hollywood movie.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="death">So long and thanks for all the fish</h3>
                    <p class="history-first">And then, it happened. On <time datetime="2001-05-11">May 11, 2001</time>, Adams had a massive heart attach at his local gym. He wasn&apos;t even 50 when he died. His death was mourned with tears and tributes from all around the world. This wasn&apos;t the regular sadness we feel when someone we know of passes away, this was a keenly felt pain, almost personal, as if we had lost a close friend.</p>
                    <p class="history history-last">And just like that, Douglas Adams, the writer who has bent our minds in unforeseeable dimensions vanished into the abyss.</p>

                    <p>The genius of Hitchhiker&apos;s, one of the most unique sci-fi pieces that&apos;s ever been written, doesn&apos;t lie in the plot, but in the tone which felt like the author was talking to the reader personally and in the absurd concepts; such as Deep Thought &lpar;a supercomputer which spends centuries calculating the meaning of <cite>life the universe and everything</cite> only to find the answer to be 42&rpar;, Marvin &lpar;an android whose brain is capable of comprehending the futility of his own existence and spends the series in a state of permanent depression&rpar;, a towel which can be useful in the most unexpected situations, time travelling sofas and a spaceship crewed entirely by the most useless members of society.</p>

                    <p>The idea of a guide to the galaxy came to Adams while he was in need of one, not to the galaxy but to Europe of course, gazing into a starry night, lying drunk on a field in Austria. He was just a young adult on the verge of his 20&apos;s. However, it took Adams almost 4 years to put the idea into work. After starting out as a radio series in <time datetime="1978">1978</time>, the Hitchhiker&apos;s soon became a world-wide best seller book series.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The long history of the Hitchhiker&apos;s &mdash; Don&apos;t panic!</h4>
                    <p class="history-first">On a faithful day of <time datetime="1977-02">February of 1977</time>, Adams had a life-changing lunch meeting with a BBC producer who asked him to try his hand on the pilot episode for a sci-fi comedy series.</p>
                    <p class="history">As he was writing the pilot, the concept of the Armageddon was replaced with the idea he has got in the fields of Austria: His alien character Ford Prefect would be a researcher for <cite>The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy</cite> and go on adventures with his human pal Arthur Dent. By March of the same year, the BBC gave the show a green light to go and the production began by June. Adams put considerable time and effort to make the show outstandingly unique. By fall, while the pilot was being circulated around the BBC, everybody was talking about how much they loved it.</p>
                    <p class="history">On <time datetime="1978-03-08">8 March 1978</time>, the first episode of <cite>The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy</cite> was broadcast on Radio 4 and brought success beyond Adams&apos; expectations. With more success came more demands. This was problematic for Adams: since he was unable to refuse any interesting writing opportunity, he was usually in a never-ending cycle of alcohol, procrastination and writing in panic. Yet again, in one way or another, he still got this work done.</p>
                    <p class="history">By early <time datetime="1979">1979</time>, Adams was in a catastrophic state of procrastination on the book adaptation of Hitchhiker&apos;s, with almost nothing written. Finally, as the deadline approached, his editor just told him to finish whatever page he was on and hand it over. The first book was published in <time datetime="1979-09">September 1979</time>, and immediately became a best seller. In <time datetime="1980">1980</time> the second season of the Hitchhiker&apos;s went out on radio following with the second book <cite>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</cite>, and a BAFTA-winning TV adaptation for the BBC.</p>
                    <p class="history">For his third book of the series, he cannibalized one of his ideas from unproduced scripts of Doctor Who, so “Life, the Universe and  Everything” was publish in <time datetime="1982">1982</time>. The fourth book which came out in 1984, was a true downfall. Adams would later say <cite>&quot;To be honest, I really shouldn&apos;t have written it, and I felt that when I was writing it. I did the best I could, but it wasn&apos;t, you know, from the heart.&quot;</cite></p>
                    <p class="history">After 4 books bringing many awards and appreciation from all around the globe, in 1992, the fifthe book the Hitchhiker&apos;s <cite>Mostly Harmless</cite> was released. And it was reflecting the bleakest period of the author&apos;s life by being the bleakest work he&apos;s written.</p>
                    <p class="history">The fifth book <cite>Mostly Harmless</cite> came out more than half a decade after the first one. Adams was struggling with an immense block. There are even stories that tell that the publisher hired a fleet of writers so sit downstairs, brainstorming and developing ideas based on Adams&apos; outline, until Adams was finally able to put himself to work by the thought of all those other writers doing his book wrong. The book remains to be the bleakest work of Adams.</p>

                    <h3 id="doctor-who">Doctor Who</h3>
                    <p>I guess it would be more than fair to say that Adams saved Doctor Who&apos;s ass for a year.</p>
                    <p>While working on Hitchhiker&apos;s, he got an offer he couldn&apos;t refuse to become a script editor in Doctor Who. He accepted the job out of fondness of the show with a mistaken belief that it wouldn&apos;t require much of his time and energy. He soon discovered that he wasn&apos;t only script editing, but also doing the work of ten people by turning 4-5 pages of scenarios into hours of stories.</p>  
                    <p>His highlight of the series was <cite>City of Death</cite>: a four-part story set in Paris where the Doctor steals the Mona Lisa, meets Leonardo da Vinci, shares a scene with John Cleese, and accidentally creates all life on Earth.</p>

                    <h3 id="dirk-gently">Dirk Gently</h3>
                    <p>After overcoming his writer&apos;s block, he again went back to and unproduced Doctor Who script and developed one of his former ideas. In <time datetime="1987">1987</time>, he published his first book of the series <cite>Dirk Gently Holistic Detective Agency</cite>. The sequel <cite>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Sould</cite> was released in <time datetime="1988">1988</time>.</p>
                    <p><cite>Dirk Gently</cite> was considered his work that his fandom had been craving for so long. His incredibly charming and weird tone was again mesmerizing his fandom. There are even fans who prefers this series over the Hitchhiker&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>There were two TV adaptations of the books, but none of them could catch upto Adams&apos; writing; they failed to reflect Adams&apos; spirit which made the series beloved by so many.</p>

                    <h2>Personality</h2>
                    <p>Considering he was friends with Pink Floyd, Douglas Adams was pretty cool. But what was it about him so uniquely cool? As a developer, I can build an entire page describing Adams&apos; personality based on the things I read online. But I assume you&apos;ve already got an idea on the way his mind works based on his life and work. So finally, let&apos;s see his legacy other than sci-fi, and let our minds interpret Adams' personality for us. After all, isn't life what we experience rather than facts?</p> 
                </div>
                
                <div class="details">
                    <h3 id="technology">Technology Enthusiasm</h3>
                    <p>Adams was both vastly influenced by and immeasurably influenced technology. That&apos;s why when you Google “the answer to life the universe and everything” you get a calculator with a result of 42. He was one of the firsts to grasp what the coming information age would mean and bring, touring around the USA giving lectures on this.</p>
                    <p>From an early age, he was into cars, devices, gadgets, and computers. From its&apos; early days, he was amazed by Apple and all of its&apos; products. He was more than a fan-boy, and has won the title <cite>Apple Master</cite>.</p>

                    <h3 id="nature">Environmental Activism</h3>
                    <p>In 1985, Adams was sent alongside zoologist Mark Carwardine to Madagascar to write an article about endangered species for the Observer. The two hit it off and a couple of years later, did a radio series together about endangered animals. That show changed Adams&apos; life. The show and its book <cite>Last Chance to See</cite> was a personal wake-up call to the damage humans were doing to their environment, their and so many others&apos; home. He became one of the earliest and loudest voices on conservation of nature and the dangers posed by habitat destruction.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="religion">Radical Atheism</h3>
                    <p>Adams was, as he called himself, a radical atheist. He emphasized on radical not be mistaken for agnostic. Though, he was fascinated the effect religion had on millions. He once said on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111218084109/http://www.atheists.org/interview:__douglas_adams" target="_blank">interview with Dave Silvermann:</a> &quot;I love to keep poking and prodding at it. I've thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing.&quot;</p>
